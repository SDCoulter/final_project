# Final Project - Climate Change and Effects on Human Well-Being (Quality of Life)

## Work in this Branch

* `happiness_report_analysis.ipynb` - notebook reads in the Happiness Report and performs analysis to reduce country list down to just those with data points from 2010-2019, as well as 2021, and exports the table to a CSV file.
* `air_quality_api_pull.ipynb` - notebook was intended to be used to pull historical air quality data from OpenWeatherMap API, however this API only goes back to 2020, not many years as required.
* `qol_ratings_scrape.ipynb` - notebook scrapes QoL table at Numbeo.com - we aren't using this resource at the moment though.
