# Final Project - Climate Change and Effects on Human Well-Being (Quality of Life)

## Work in this Branch

* `air_quality_api_pull.ipynb` - notebook was intended to be used to pull historical air quality data from OpenWeatherMap API, however this API only goes back to 2020, not many years as required.
* `qol_ratings_scrape.ipynb` - notebook scrapes QoL table at Numbeo.com - we aren't using this resource at the moment though.
