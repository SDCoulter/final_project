# Greenhouse Gasses
Data was filtered and and sorted to include only the countries and years in the main dataset and then merged.

For 2010-2018: data was pulled from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.GHGT.KT.CE, which contains total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent) by country (Missing Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia & Taiwan).

The data shows a slight correlation when it comes to per capita emissions, where all countries lower on the life ladder (less than five) have relatively lower emissions per capita and all of the countires that do have relatively high emissions/capita are also higher on the life ladder (greater than 5). A hypothesis can be formed from this information, where countries higher up on the life ladder are more developed, giving them more opportunity to conduct a activities that create greenhouse gas emissions.
