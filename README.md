# Final Project - Climate Change and Effects on Human Well-Being (Quality of Life)

## Overview

This is the repository for Module 20, the ***Final Project***, of the University of Toronto Data Analysis Bootcamp Course. Work created and organized by Akinsola Salami, Jeffrey Au, and Shaun Coulter.

## Communication Protocols

We currently plan to do our analysis with the use of the following tools (more tools will be added as needed):

* **Python**
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * TensorFlow
  * scikit-learn
  * Matplotlib
* **JavaScript**
  * Mapbox
  * Leaflet
  * Plotly
  * D3
* **SQL**
  * PostgreSQL
  * pgAdmin
* Tableau
* Web Development Tools (HTML/CSS)

## Our Data Story

We are set out to find how our world is affecting us, we begin by asking the questions:

* Is there any link in where we live to how happy we can be?
* Do happier people move to the countryside?
* How does the quality of the air and water affect us, health and development?
* How is the quality of life of those in areas of high income (air, water, mental health)?
* What does that look like in the future?

## Potential Variables

* **Climate**:
  * Weather
  * Temperature
  * Air Quality
  * Greenhouse Gases
  * Water Quality
  * Rainfall
* **Human Well-Being / Quality of Life**:
  * Happiness Index
  * General Health
  * Life Expectancy
  * Mental Health
* **Comparable Variables**:
  * Population Density - Country Life vs. City Life
  * Income per Capita vs. Climate vs. General Health (Development Measure)

## Presentation

We hope to create:

* A number of maps, to show variable correlation.
* A way for a user to interact with the variables and plot their own maps.
* A number of graphs.

## Database

Our database will be created with pgAdmin and Postgres. We will include schema information, as well as queries that produce the data we analyse.

## Machine Learning

We will develop on our question of ***what will that look like in the future***? As well as possibly using available data from G7 countries (a lot of easy to access data) to try and predict future trends in countries where data is lacking.

We will use the module template, and specifically topics discussed in Module 17, 18, and 19, to model the data we find. We will be looking at both prediction/regression modelling as well as classification.
